  name: Delivering Blind XSS Payloads via Headers
  author: panch0r3d
  severity: varies
  description: |
    This template attempts to deliver a Blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payload through various HTTP headers. 
    It targets endpoints that may improperly handle user-supplied values in headers and subsequently inject scripts.
  remediation: Ensure that headers are properly sanitized and validated. Implement CSP (Content Security Policy) and other XSS mitigation techniques.
