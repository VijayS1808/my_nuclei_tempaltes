  name: Host Header Injection via X-Forwarded-Host
  author: melbadry9
  severity: low
  description: |
    Detects Host Header Injection vulnerabilities where an application improperly handles the `X-Forwarded-Host` header. This can lead to potential issues such as web cache poisoning, bypassing security mechanisms, and phishing.
  remediation: |
    Validate and sanitize the `Host` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers. Ensure only trusted values are accepted and consider whitelisting allowed domains or rejecting invalid headers.
