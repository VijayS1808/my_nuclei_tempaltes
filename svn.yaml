  name: Exposed SVN Directory Detection
  author: udit_thakkur & dwisiswant0
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Detects the exposure of Subversion (SVN) repository directories, such as `.svn/entries` and `.svn/prop-base/`. Exposing SVN directories can lead to sensitive version control information being publicly accessible, including repository paths, revision history, and commit details.
  recommendation: |
    It is recommended to restrict access to `.svn/` directories through server configuration (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to prevent unauthorized access to version control metadata.

requests:
  - method: GET
    path:
      - "{{BaseURL}}/.svn/entries"
      - "{{BaseURL}}/.svn/prop-base/"
      - "{{BaseURL}}/.svn/text-base/"
