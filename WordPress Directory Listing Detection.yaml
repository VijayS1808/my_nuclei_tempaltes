  severity: info
  description: |
    Detects the presence of an open directory listing in the `/wp-content/uploads/` directory of a WordPress site. Open directory listings can reveal sensitive files and metadata to unauthorized users.
  recommendation: |
    If directory listing is not required, it is highly recommended to disable it by configuring the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to prevent exposing file structures.
